\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we conducted a comprehensive exploration of the impact of client drift and period drift on the performance of cross-device FL, discovering that period drift can be particularly harmful as data heterogeneity increases. To solve this challenge, we introduced a novel predict-observe framework and a method, FedEve, that views these drifts as noise associated with prediction and observation. By integrating these two sources in a principled way through a Kalman filter-based approach, we provided a better estimation of model update steps, reducing variance and improving the stability and convergence speed of FL. Our theoretical analysis showed that FedEve can effectively bound the variance of model updates, while extensive empirical evaluations demonstrated that it significantly outperforms alternative methods across different tasks and datasets.
% The insights gained from this work shed light on future directions for improving efficiency in FL, particularly in handling data heterogeneity and client sampling challenges.
We believe our framework opens up new possibilities for developing more robust and efficient FL algorithms.
